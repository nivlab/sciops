  abstract = "Infrequency scales are becoming a popular mode of data screening,
              due to their availability and ease of implementation. Recent
              research has indicated that the interpretation and functioning of
              infrequency items may not be as straightforward as had previously
              been thought (Curran \& Hauser, 2015), yet there are no
              empirically based guidelines for implementing cutoffs using these
              items. In the present study, we compared two methods of detecting
              random responding with infrequency items: a zero-tolerance
              threshold versus a threshold that balances classification error
              rates. The results showed that a traditional zero-tolerance
              approach, on average, screens data that are less indicative of
              careless responding than those screened by the error-balancing
              approach. Thus, the de facto standard of applying a
              ``zero-tolerance'' approach when screening participants with
              infrequency scales may be too stringent, so that meaningful
              responses may also be removed from analyses. Recommendations and
              future directions are discussed.",
