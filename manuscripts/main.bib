@ARTICLE{Katahira2018-ke,
  title    = "The statistical structures of reinforcement learning with
              asymmetric value updates",
  author   = "Katahira, Kentaro",
  abstract = "Reinforcement learning (RL) models have been broadly used in
              modeling the choice behavior of humans and other animals. In
              standard RL models, the action values are assumed to be updated
              according to the reward prediction error (RPE), i.e., the
              difference between the obtained reward and the expected reward.
              Numerous studies have noted that the magnitude of the update is
              biased depending on the sign of the RPE. The bias is represented
              in RL models by differential learning rates for positive and
              negative RPEs. However, which aspect of behavioral data that the
              estimated differential learning rates reflect is not well
              understood. In this study, we investigate how the differential
              learning rates influence the statistical properties of choice
              behavior (i.e., the relation between past experiences and the
              current choice) based on theoretical considerations and numerical
              simulations. We clarify that when the learning rates differ, the
              impact of a past outcome depends on the subsequent outcomes, in
              contrast to standard RL models with symmetric value updates.
              Based on the results, we propose a model-neutral statistical test
              to validate the hypothesis that value updates are asymmetric. The
              asymmetry in the value updates induces the autocorrelation of
              choice (i.e., the tendency to repeat the same choice or to switch
              the choice irrespective of past rewards). Conversely, if an RL
              model without an intrinsic autocorrelation factor is fitted to
              data that possess an intrinsic autocorrelation, a statistical
              bias to overestimate the difference in learning rates arises. We
              demonstrate that this bias can cause a statistical artifact in
              RL-model fitting leading to a ``pseudo-positivity bias'' and a
              ``pseudo-confirmation bias.''",

              Louie, Kristine A and King, Kevin M",
  abstract = "Infrequency scales are becoming a popular mode of data screening,
              due to their availability and ease of implementation. Recent
              research has indicated that the interpretation and functioning of
              infrequency items may not be as straightforward as had previously
              been thought (Curran \& Hauser, 2015), yet there are no
              empirically based guidelines for implementing cutoffs using these
              items. In the present study, we compared two methods of detecting
              random responding with infrequency items: a zero-tolerance
              threshold versus a threshold that balances classification error
              rates. The results showed that a traditional zero-tolerance
              approach, on average, screens data that are less indicative of
              careless responding than those screened by the error-balancing
              approach. Thus, the de facto standard of applying a
              ``zero-tolerance'' approach when screening participants with
              infrequency scales may be too stringent, so that meaningful
              responses may also be removed from analyses. Recommendations and
              future directions are discussed.",
